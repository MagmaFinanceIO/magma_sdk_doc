# APR correlation calculation

## 1. Pool APR

We have integrated the calculation of the pool's APR into our statistics service, and now you can directly obtain these data through the statistics interface.

Pool Info API

- Mainnet: https://magmafinance.io/api/v2/sui/swap/count

There are three type apr you can get.

- 24 h: data.pools[x].apr_24h

- 7 day: data.pools[x].apr_7day

- 30 day: data.pools[x].apr_30day

## Position APR

1. We use the `estPositionAPRWithMultiMethod` method in the SDK to calculate the multi coefficient `m`, and the parameters passed to this method come from the Magma statistics interface.

2. Use coefficient `m` multiply the reward APRs respectively and then add them together.

```typescript
export function estPositionAPRWithMultiMethod(
  lowerUserPrice: number,
  upperUserPrice: number,
  lowerHistPrice: number,
  upperHistPrice: number
) {}
```

Param explanation

- lowerUserPrice and upperUserPrice are the price of one position.

- lowerHistPrice and upperHistPrice are come from the magma statistics interface.

Price Statistics API

- Mainnet: https://magmafinance.io/api/v2/sui/contract/price

lowerHistPrice and upperHistPrice come from data.list[x].data[x].
there are three types `before_24_h_xx`„ÄÅ `before_7_d_xx` and `before_30_d_xx`.

The pool rewards apr come from the above mentioned pool info API, `data.pools[x].rewarder_apr`.
